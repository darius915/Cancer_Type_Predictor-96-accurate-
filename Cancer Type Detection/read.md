This model can predict two types of cancer:
  1.Malignant cancer
  2.Bening cancer

What is Malignant and Bening cancer?

1. Benign Tumors:
Benign tumors are non-cancerous growths of cells.
They do not invade nearby tissues or spread to other parts of the body.
Typically, they are encapsulated and well-defined.
Benign tumors often have a slow and steady rate of growth.
They are generally not life-threatening, although they can cause health problems if they compress nearby organs or tissues.
Examples of benign tumors include uterine fibroids, skin moles, and some types of ovarian cysts.

2. Malignant Tumors (Cancer):
Malignant tumors are cancerous growths of cells.
They have the ability to invade nearby tissues and, if left untreated, can spread to other parts of the body. This process is known as metastasis.
Malignant tumors lack the controlled growth and structure of normal cells.
They often have irregular or poorly defined borders.
Malignant tumors can be life-threatening, and they require prompt medical attention and treatment.
Cancers can occur in various parts of the body and can be further categorized based on the type of tissue or cell from which they originate. Common examples of malignant cancers include breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer.
